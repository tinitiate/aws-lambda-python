### AWS SAM CLI

* The AWS SAM CLI (Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface) is a tool provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) to facilitate the development, testing, and deployment of serverless applications using the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM). 

* AWS SAM is an open-source framework for building serverless applications using AWS resources such as AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon DynamoDB, and more.

* The AWS SAM CLI extends the capabilities of the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) and offers a set of commands specifically designed to simplify the serverless development workflow. 
* Enables developers to define serverless applications using a template format, test their code locally, and deploy applications to AWS CloudFormation stacks.

## Key Concepts

1. **AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM):** AWS SAM is an open-source framework that extends AWS CloudFormation to define and deploy serverless applications. It provides a simplified way to define Lambda functions, APIs, and other AWS resources using a concise YAML or JSON template.
2. **Lambda Functions:** AWS Lambda allows you to run code in response to events without provisioning or managing servers. The SAM CLI helps you create, test, and deploy Lambda functions along with the required resources and permissions.
3. **API Gateway:** Amazon API Gateway lets you create, publish, and manage APIs for your applications. The SAM CLI supports local testing of APIs using the `sam local start-api` command.
4. **Local Development:** The SAM CLI provides features for testing and debugging serverless applications on your local machine. This includes emulating Lambda function invocations and local API Gateway testing.
5. **Deployment:** With the SAM CLI, you can package and deploy your serverless applications to AWS using the `sam deploy` command. It leverages AWS CloudFormation to create or update stacks based on your application template.

## Benefits

1. **Local Testing:** The SAM CLI enables you to test your serverless application locally, allowing you to catch and fix issues before deploying to AWS.
2. **Simplified Deployment:** Deploying serverless applications with the SAM CLI is simplified through the integration with AWS CloudFormation. This helps maintain consistent and repeatable deployments.
3. **Resource Management:** SAM templates allow you to define resources and their relationships, making it easier to manage and maintain complex serverless architectures.
4. **Rapid Iteration:** With local development and testing, you can rapidly iterate on your code and configurations without waiting for full deployment cycles.
5. **Integration with AWS Services:** The SAM CLI seamlessly integrates with various AWS services, enabling you to use features like API Gateway, Lambda, and more within your serverless applications.

## SAM Template Topology Components:

1. **Globals:**
   - The `Globals` section is optional and defines default values for resource properties that can be overridden at the resource level. This helps ensure consistent settings across resources.
2. **Parameters:**
   - The `Parameters` section defines input parameters that allow you to customize the behavior of the template during stack creation. Parameters make templates reusable and configurable for different environments.
3. **Resources:**
   - The `Resources` section is the heart of the SAM template. It defines the serverless resources that constitute your application, such as Lambda functions, API Gateway APIs, event sources, DynamoDB tables, and more. Each resource has a logical ID and properties.
4. **Outputs:**
   - The `Outputs` section defines values that you want to export from the stack after creation. These values can be used in other stacks or by external applications. Outputs allow for sharing information between stacks.
5. **Conditions:**
   - The `Conditions` section allows you to define conditions based on input parameters. Conditions can be used to control whether certain resources are created or to set property values based on conditions.
6. **Mappings:**
   - The `Mappings` section allows you to define a set of static values that you can reference in your template. Mappings are useful for parameterizing templates and defining values based on conditions.

### SAM Template Topology Explanation:

The SAM template topology forms a hierarchy where resources and other constructs are defined within specific sections. Here's how it all comes together:

1. **Defining Resources:**
   - Within the `Resources` section, you define the serverless resources that your application requires. These resources can include Lambda functions, APIs, event sources, DynamoDB tables, and more. SAM provides shorthand syntax to simplify resource definitions.
2. **Resource Interactions:**
   - Resources defined in the `Resources` section can interact with each other. For example, a Lambda function can be triggered by an event source, such as an S3 bucket or an API Gateway endpoint. These interactions are specified using properties within the resource definitions.
3. **Parameterization:**
   - The `Parameters` section allows you to parameterize various aspects of your resources, such as Lambda function runtime, memory, and more. This parameterization makes your template flexible and adaptable to different requirements.
4. **Outputs and Sharing:**
   - The `Outputs` section lets you define values that are accessible after stack creation. These outputs can be used by other stacks or external applications to access information from the deployed resources.
5. **Conditions and Logic:**
   - The `Conditions` section enables you to define logical conditions based on input parameters. This logic can determine whether certain resources are created or configure resource properties based on conditions.
